Introduction
===================
I wanted to create a very simple application for Power Naps. This is my first standalone Android application, which I published in the Google Play store. During coding this app, I've gained a lot of experience. There's a lot of dirty code and I'm not proud of it, but my main assumption was to learn HOW to do something. Time for learning HOW TO DO IT BETTER is coming now.

Application has got only very basic GUI, but in my opinion it's enough neat for comfortable use. If you want, just download code and do whatever you want with it.
